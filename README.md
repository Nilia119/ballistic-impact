# Goko ballistic Impact

Description:
Head wounds cause removal of protective glass, head mounted display and/or helmet of unit depending on damage, spawns particle effects accordingly. Factors such as Item present or not, helmet's armor level, weapon caliber and 'chance' taken into account in order to simulate bullet impact realistic as possible.

Features:
Brand new visual effects for head wounds, fatal or not.

particle effects: friction sparks, glass shards, blood, fire dust, electric parts failure smoke, headgear parts and hat / helmet fly-off

Randomized particle effects according to gear present on unit

Each effect is randomized within itself for authentic simulation

HMD / Helmet destruction by a head wound mainly depends on chance which is currently at %77

HMDs can be broken with a non fatal shot. This depends on used weapon type and damage value.

Helmets can only be destroyed with weapon calibers equal to and/or higher than 7.62

Other factors such as helmet's armor level taken into account with weapon caliber for a better simulation

5 different sound samples for HMD destruction played random each time

8 different sound samples for helmet taking heavy damage

Damage from a very high caliber weapon such as .50cal mounted on offroad, GM6 Lynx can cause parts to catch fire briefly

In order to make 'catch fire briefly' fx visible you have to have particles 'high' in video options

Performance demand of this add-on is minimal as It uses no loops and nothing is added to Arma scheduler
